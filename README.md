<h1>GreatDay</h1>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
Mental wellness is often left out when people think about national issues. However, it is a prevalent problem that occurs in the lives of many people. According to a recent study, 1 in 5 students suffer from depression, mainly from academic stress but also from personal/family issues. Many of these people continue to live their lives without seeking counseling and continue to view everyday life veryr negatively.

<p>
There are many correlations between mental wellness and physical health, mental wellness and drug use. By living life more positively, people can focus more on other things rather than dwelling on negative aspects.
</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
GreatDay is inspired by a homework assignment from a course that I'm taking, Science of Happiness. The Good Day assignment was to track all of the positive activities that occur in a 1-week time span. Through that assignment, I saw what specific activities made me happier. Although it may sound obvious, many people don't actually realize it. I was able to physically see the trend and correlation between my happiness and activities.

The GreatDay project is an iOS application that allows users to set a mood (happy, meh, sad) for each day and add individual activities (which are also associated with moods) for that day. Using that information, the user can view their statistics such as activities that often make them happy, activities that often make them sad. Furthermore, the application also recommends specific activities that may make the user happier based on the current time that they are on the app. GreatDay also provides visualizations such as a pie chart and bar graph showing the changes in moods and mood counts.
